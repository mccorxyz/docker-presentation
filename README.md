# Docker Presentation

Here lies the Docker presentation that I gave in September 2024 to the University of Minnesota Duluth ACM club.

The presentation is written in markdown and can be easily rendered if you utilize the recommended extensions in the `.vscode` directory.

The presentation is far from all encompasing. At times we went off on tangents and pointed out specifics as we tackled each demo.

## Running the demos

I've added a `playbook.md` file to the root of each demo directory. It explains the demo, the value of the demo, and the commands necessary to try the demo for yourself.
